import random
```

---

### 2. **Define Game Options**

```python
options = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
```

---

### 3. **Set Winning Conditions**

```python
win_conditions = {
    "rock": "scissors",
    "paper": "rock",

### 4. **Create the Game Function**

```python
def play_game():
    print("🎮 Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!")
```

---

### 5. **Add Game Loop and Input Handling**

```python
    while True:
        user = input("Choose rock, paper or scissors (or 'q' to quit): ").lower()

        if user == 'q':
            print("👋 Thanks for playing! Goodbye!")
            break

        if user not in options:
            print("❌ Invalid choice. Please try again.")
            continue
```

---

### 6. **Generate Computer’s Move**

```python
        computer = random.choice(options)
```

---

### 7. **Display Choices and Determine Winner**

```python
        print(f"\nYou chose: {user}")
        print(f"Computer chose: {computer}")

        if user == computer:
            print("🤝 It's a tie!\n")
        elif win_conditions[user] == computer:
            print("✅ You win!\n")
        else:
            print("💻 Computer wins!\n")
```

---

### 8. **Run the Game**

```python
play_game()
```
